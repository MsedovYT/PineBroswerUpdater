**VERSION SPECIFIC NOTES**

v.0.2: In PineBrowser, you might notice 2 new files: easylist.txt, and light.qss. These files are mandatory for startup, as they include the themes, and the adblocker extension. To make v.0.2 work, you must download these two files, and place them into the browser directory, without renaming them or refractoring them in any way.
